# Sankyo-1000-Projector-Parts
Here are some STL and OpenSCAD parts for my Proejctor.

I made a Telecine machine out of it using the great lighting kit from http://cine2digits.co.uk/

The Projector was missing the plastic plate that kept the film on track to the other reel.  Didn't realize it till the film spooled out of the slot and I found a picture of the missing part.  This is included as well.

The bracket for the lighting solution could also be used for a bright led lamp instead of the bulb.  The projector outputs 8V to the 50W bulb, so converting it to DC should be easy.

Few other notes, there is this little oil resoverow with a wick that oils a shaft that moves the film a frame at a time.  If that resvere is empty, after a while it starts making a squeeking sound.  I just filled it back up with household oil.  You might be tempted to remove the fan on the motor but the fan cools both the transformer and the rheostat durring operation.  Those things get hot.

Use these STL's anyway you like, its all MIT
